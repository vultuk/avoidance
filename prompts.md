I've checked the game and 1. Running into particle wave doesn't end the game. 2. There should only ever be one particle wave on screen at once. Please fix this, commit, push and release a new version

3. Important files and code sections
4. Any errors encountered and how they were resolved
5. The current state of the project
6. Any pending tasks or next steps

Please be thorough and include specific details that would be helpful for continuity.

## Continue Work

## Wave Clarification
Just to note, it is possible to have 1 blue and 1 orange particle wave on screen at the same time in medium and above modes

## Release Reminder
You haven't created a release

## Bug Report 2 (v2.0.0)
Ok. Few bugs. 1. Medium mode. The game ends when the orange ship touches the blue particle wave. This is incorrect. The game should only end when a ship touches the wave ofit's own colour. 2. Shields should be attached to the ship, not positioned on the 'screen'. They should move with the ship and be the colour of the wave it protects from. e.g. The blue ship should have orange shields on the left and right, the orange ship should have blue shields on the top and bottom.

## Prompts Storage Request
Please store all of the prompts I give you in @prompts.md. Add all the previous prompts and then going forward every new prompt.
