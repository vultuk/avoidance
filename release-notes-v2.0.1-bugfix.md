# Avoidance Game v2.0.1 - Critical Bug Fixes

## üêõ Major Bug Fixes

This release fixes critical gameplay issues in Medium and Hard modes:

### Fixed Issues:

#### 1. Collision Detection (Medium/Hard Modes)
- **Fixed**: Ships now only collide with waves of their matching color
  - Blue ship only collides with blue waves (from top)
  - Orange ship only collides with orange waves (from left)
- **Previous bug**: Ships were incorrectly ending the game when touching any wave color

#### 2. Shield System Redesign (Hard Mode)
- **Fixed**: Shields are now properly attached to ships and move with them
- **Shield Configuration**:
  - Blue ship: Orange shields on left and right sides
  - Orange ship: Blue shields on top and bottom
- **Shield Colors**: Each shield matches the color of waves it protects from
  - Orange shields protect from orange waves
  - Blue shields protect from blue waves
- **Visual Update**: Shield health now shown through opacity changes
  - Full health: 100% opacity
  - Damaged: 70% opacity
  - Critical: 40% opacity
